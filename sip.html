      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        My SIP (Senior Innovation Project) introduces a novel attachment for commercial sectionizers, such as the
        <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/sunkist-s-100-commercial-sectionizer/771S100.html" target="_blank">Sunkist S-100</a>.
        While sectionizers efficiently cut fruits like lemons and limes into uniform wedges, they do not perform the critical next step: scoring each wedge so it can be easily placed on the rim of a cocktail glass.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, bartenders or prep staff must manually score each fruit wedge using a knife—one by one. This process is time-consuming and tedious, especially at scale. My innovation is a mechanical scoring attachment that integrates directly into existing sectionizer machines.
      </p>

      <p>
        With this device, all wedges are scored simultaneously as part of the same motion that sections the fruit. This reduces labor, increases consistency, and enables much faster cocktail garnish prep in restaurants, bars, and catering services.
